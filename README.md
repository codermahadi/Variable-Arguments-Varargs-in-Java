# Variable-Arguments-Varargs-in-Java
 Java has included a feature that simplifies the creation of methods that need to take a variable number of arguments. This feature is called varargs and it is short-form for variable-length arguments. A method that takes a variable number of arguments is a varargs method. Prior to JDK 5, variable-length arguments could be handled two ways. One using overloaded method(one for each) and another put the arguments into an array, and then pass this array to the method. Both of them are potentially error-prone and require more code. The varargs feature offers a simpler, better option.
